# CHS-Moodle-Fixer
*Imagine having to fix the school's Moodle yourself.*

Due to a recent migration of the school's intranet, heaps of stuff broke.

One of the most significant problems is that the school's Moodle is quite broken.  
Possibly due to some misconfiguration, one could barely access it at home.

As a feeble attempt to recover some of Moodle's features,  
this chromium extension makes necessary changes to the browser, including:
- Forcing the correct URI scheme to be used where necessary (e.g. HTTP)
- Mapping old URLs to new ones through chromium's built-in redirection feature

***However, this patch is extremely unstable; it is by no means a reliable solution to this persistent issue.***

Let's just hope somebody actually fixes Moodle before we all graduate.

  

> **NOTE**: Moodle is mostly working when you are connected to the school's Wi-Fi. 
Therefore, this extension is not needed if you only access it at school. 

## Installation
I really can't be bothered to put this up onto the Chrome Web Store.

Therefore, in order to install this extension, 
please refer to [Google Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked)

official guides on loading unpacked extensions.
